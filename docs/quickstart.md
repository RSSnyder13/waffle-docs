# Waffle Quickstart

The Waffle CLI keeps track of every deployment created with it in a local config file. Creating a deployment means that a settings file is created, and AWS components are created based on the settings using CloudFormation. It's possible to change the settings later on, the Waffle CLI can invoke AWS CloudFormation to update the existing AWS components accordingly.
